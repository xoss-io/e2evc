The tool you choose to deploy your infrastructure is dependend on what your requirements are. 
If you are running on one infrastructure it is perfectly fine to use Cloudformation an AWS, Azure ARM on Azure or SCCM on your on-premises infrastructure.

> For those using SCCM: Is this the software deployment tool that is capable of managing you infrastructure deployments in the future. You should think about a mindest change.

> If you are thinking about multi-cloud you should definitely have a look at Terraform.
