# Semantic Versioning

Software versioning is the most widely adopted scheme for assigning unique version version numbers to software releases.

We practice Semantic Versioning for all projects. Using this versioning standard helps to reduce the entropy related to Dependency Hell.

## Semantics

Generally, all of our versions follow this convention: X.Y.Z (e.g. 1.2.3). Sometimes, weâ€™ll use this format: X.Y.Z-branch when we need to disambiguate between versions existing in multiple branches.

**Major Releases** - These are releases when X changes. These releases will typically have major changes in the interface. These releases may not be backward-compatible.
**Minor Releases** - These are releases when Y changes. These releases bundle new features, but the interface should be largely the same. Minor releases should be backward-compatible.

**Patch Releases** - These are releases when Z changes. These releases are typically bug fixes which do not introduce new features. These releases are backward-compatible.

We use Git tags & releases for all versioning.

## Versioning

We always start projects off at 0.1.0. This is our first release of any project. While we try to keep our interfaces stable, as long as X=0, it indicates that our code does not yet have a stable API and may vary radically between minor releases.

As soon as our code reaches 1.X.Y, the interface should be relatively stable - that is not changing much between minor releases.

## Implementation

Managing semantic versions should be automated just like everything else in your infrastructure.

## Usage in Terraform Modules

Reference different module changes with semantic versioning to and reference them in your development stages:

git::ssh://git@ssh.dev.azure.com/v3/XOSS/infrastructure/xoss-terraform-labels.git?ref=v0.1.0"

After succesfull test create a pull request and merge the changes into your master branch. From there on use "master" as reference:

git::ssh://git@ssh.dev.azure.com/v3/XOSS/infrastructure/xoss-terraform-labels.git?ref=master"
