# E2EVC

This is the repository for the E2EVC DIGITAL | THE WORLD - Automation Masterclass

## Agenda

### Prerequisites

First of all we should talk about some of the basic things we need to know before we start automating our tech-stack with infrastructure as Code.

#### Git

Git is the first pillar for everything we do in a fully automated Infrastructure as Code environment. So we should talk about some basics.

#### MarkDown

MarkDown is the second pillar in this space. Infrastructure as Code without documentation might leave you lost in the jungle of tools, processes and technologies.

#### Semantic Versioning

Versioning should be used in all modules and applications that you and your colleagues build.

#### Scrum

The typical work form of how development and infrastructure deplyoments are organized.

### Image Management

If you want to run workloads on on-premises or cloud infrastructures you should implement customized operating system images.

### Platform Management

We shouldnÂ´t deploy infrastructures manually today. So what could we do to do it in an automatic way?

### Configuration Management

When operating system images are ready and the basic infrastructure is provisioned it is time to configure the nodes and bring the infrastructure to life.

### Lessons learned

We should talk about some of the problems you could run into when starting to work with the above mentioned technologies.
