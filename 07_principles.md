# Principles

## Everything that can be standardized will be standardized

We belive that the only action to make infrastructure deployments and infrastructure services a commodity is to standardize as much as possible.

## Everything that can be automated will be automated

We belive that the only way to overcome the lack of skilled staff and the growing cost pressure within all departments can beachieved be automating as much as possible.

## Everything that can be connected will be connected

We belive that truly innovation can only be achieved by connecting every device, every infrastructure component, no matter where it lives.

## Everything that can be analyzed will be analyzed

We belive that data is the new gold and we can only improve infrastructure and automation processes by analyzing them and improving the deployment processes.
